### Software Engineering Team

**Egoless Team**

Our software engineering team is organized within an egoless and democratic management module.
The objective of the group is set by consensus, and ideas from each member is taken for significant decisions. Group leadership revolves among members. Due to its nature, the structure allows input from all representatives, which can lead to better decisions in various problems. This suggests that the method is well suited for long-term research-type projects with less time constraints.
